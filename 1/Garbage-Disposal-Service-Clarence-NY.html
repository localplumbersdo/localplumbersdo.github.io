The efficiency of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you may not wish to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>

<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
