When it comes to the problem of difficult water, a traditional water softener really removes magnesium, silica and calcium ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is referred to as short-term solidity". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
