<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I love to prepare, I create a whole lot of meals. We set up a temporary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we realized that we required the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz remained in and out of the house within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will remain clog-free for one month. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are really pleased that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will absolutely utilize this company again and again in the future.</p>
