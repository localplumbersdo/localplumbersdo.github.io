<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
