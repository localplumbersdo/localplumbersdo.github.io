<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
