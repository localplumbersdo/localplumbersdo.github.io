<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to employ a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair costs may remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.

In addition to traditional water heaters, we also install tankless water heaters, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
