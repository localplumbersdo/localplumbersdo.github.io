<p>A decrease in supply side pressure triggered by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire battling, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release up until the supply side pressure again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
