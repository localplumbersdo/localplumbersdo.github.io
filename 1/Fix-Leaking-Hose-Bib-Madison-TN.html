<p>Hang the waste disposal unit by lining up the 3 mounting tabs with the slide-up ramps on the mounting ring. Holding the garbage disposal in location, turn the lower installing ring till all 3 tabs are locked into the installing assembly.

<p>Sometimes, leakages can be sealed by welding or comparable methods. Nevertheless, if leaks keep springing up in the same length of pipe, then it's highly likely that you're dealing with a flaw in the pipe, which needs to be replaced. If you see rust or rust on a pipe, a leak is just a matter of time. It's actually fortunate if you find corrosion before a leak takes place, considering that it provides you time to have repiping done before you're faced with a flood in your home due to a leak.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
