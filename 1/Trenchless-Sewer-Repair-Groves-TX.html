<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This big amount of garbage does not need to go in the trash bin if it can quickly and rapidly be gotten rid of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent out to landfills and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
