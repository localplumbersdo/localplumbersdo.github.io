<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
