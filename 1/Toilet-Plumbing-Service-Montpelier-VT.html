<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire security industry, creating a redundancy designed to ensure that one check valve will continue to safeguard the city water system even if the other stops working. This assembly also enables the closure of one valve to decrease the pressure differential throughout the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even small backflow leak. Test dicks, or small ball valves, allow the attachment of testing equipment that assesses whether the check assembly is practical.</p>

You need to also prevent using any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal because these chemicals will only harm the appliance further.</p>
