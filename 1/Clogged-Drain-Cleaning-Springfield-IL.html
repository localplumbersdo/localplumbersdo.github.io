<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Springfield IL</h3>
<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride may be appropriate if health or environmental reasons demand limiting salt. Over time, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regeneration procedure can be arranged automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
