However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
