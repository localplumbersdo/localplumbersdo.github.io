Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
