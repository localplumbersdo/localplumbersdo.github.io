<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
