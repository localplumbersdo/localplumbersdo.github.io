A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly defined by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to be located at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
