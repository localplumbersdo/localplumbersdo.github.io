With a water heater replacement, you'll fix your repair concerns, and have actually improved water heater performance as well.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly.

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continuously monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
