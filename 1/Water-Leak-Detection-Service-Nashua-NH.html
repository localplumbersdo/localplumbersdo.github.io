<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair costs may remain in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.

When the day comes that it stops working, this method you will not have a surprise expense on your hands.</p>
