<p>Garbage disposals are designed to operate in one of two methods. Either through what's referred to as a batch feed, where the unit is filled, then covered before it is turned on, or through a continuous feed, where the system can be filled while it is running. An authorized backflow prevention device, which should be evaluated annually, need to be set up on the service connection that the department has recognized as having a potential for backflow. Remember to inspect the background and research reviews of your sewer cleaning company.
