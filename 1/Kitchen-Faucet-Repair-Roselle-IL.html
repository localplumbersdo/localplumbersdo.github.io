<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is just capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (typically sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
