<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
