<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
