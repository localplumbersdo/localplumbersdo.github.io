<p>The water quality improvement industry has earnestly sought to figure out the accurate details on water softener system effluent. A recent sewage-disposal tank study from the Water Quality Association plainly suggests that there are no unfavorable effects when water softening drainage is discharged into appropriately set up private septic tanks.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
