<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
