<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Shepherdsville KY</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost during these events.</p>

<p>Cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal due to the fact that they can hamper the blades. Last but not least, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to ensure that all food particles have been washed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from entering the waste disposal unit, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
