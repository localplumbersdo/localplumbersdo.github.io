<p>After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water coming from your water devices? This is a great indication that your pipes might be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be replaced. Remember that if the rust-colored water only includes warm water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
