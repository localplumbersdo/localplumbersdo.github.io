<p>Mechanical failure or sediment build-up in backflow preventers can trigger extreme pressure loss. Backflow - is the undesirable reverse flow of pollutants into the safe and clean water from an end-use" hazard and is generally driven by common, but undesirable, hydraulic events in either the public or a private water distribution system.
