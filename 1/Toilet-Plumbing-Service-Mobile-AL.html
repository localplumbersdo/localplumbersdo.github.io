<p>The majority of toilets utilized today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, suggesting they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewer system. Recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in more and more houses. This system utilizes a vacuum-assisted flushing system to draw the water into the bowl and down into the drains. A disadvantage of this device is that it's a lot more difficult to unblock your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
<p>There are 2 popular install systems used for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt install (if you've had a disposer set up for some time, it's probably installed this way) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the exact same task with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name implies, the EZ Mount mechanism is intended to be simpler to handle when installing or fixing an unit.</p>
<p>Tough water, debris from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing entirely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Images 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one common kind of valve. Although other valves will look different, the clearing process is comparable. However, you may have to eliminate a few screws on top of the fill valve to remove the cap.</p>
