When water circulation stops, pressure vacuum breakers utilize a check valve designed to close with the aid of a spring. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above air pressure, preventing non-potable water from being siphoned back into the safe and clean system. The assembly consists of resistant, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
