<p>If you are upgrading your gas appliances, you need to upgrade the piping as well. Gas leaks can be unsafe and frightening. We're here for you every step of the way. Call (866) 701-5306 to set up a consultation. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically specified by water purveyors.  It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also needs to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
