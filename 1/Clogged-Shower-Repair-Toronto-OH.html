<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and spying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
