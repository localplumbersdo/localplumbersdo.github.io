Plumbing codes mandate that drinkable water products be safeguarded versus backflow at all cross-connections. We offer the largest choice of backflow prevention solutions for any application.</p>
<p>Those people in the industry understand that cross-connection programs in numerous areas have vastly minimized the number of reported incidents that happen within our water systems. This has at times resulted in individuals believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never actually have been a problem in the very first location. This thinking can be both harmful and disadvantageous. Backflow occurrences in water supply are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a minimized pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it presents and after that install the correct protection.</p>
<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge till the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Some customers like to have softer water and choose to install a water softening unit. Again, it's personal choice and completely up to the individual consumer.
