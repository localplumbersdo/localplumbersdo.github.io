This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
