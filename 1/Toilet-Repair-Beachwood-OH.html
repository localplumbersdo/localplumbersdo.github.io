<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
