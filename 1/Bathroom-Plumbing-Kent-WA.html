Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

The DEP filing fee is $350 per service connection and the DOB filing charge is a little over 1% of the estimated plumbing cost. The size of the device is likewise a factor in cost. For example, a one-inch device can begin at $225, while a three-inch device might cost $2,800. Labor expenses likewise increase with pipe size.</p>
