<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to permit water at expected operational pressure to stream through. Must backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs knock the valves shut tight, preventing the entrance of cross contamination water.</p>
