This machine clears drains and sewage systems by turning a versatile cable made from wire through the pipe. Accessories at the end of the cable help the process by scraping, boring, cutting pipe blockages like roots and sludge.

Short-term water will be permitted after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be connected to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker must be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser must be securely connected to sturdy rebar or wooden stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is significantly total is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away checked to ensure it is working.</p>
