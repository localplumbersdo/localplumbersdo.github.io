<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has actually occurred in systems which contain gases and liquids. The majority of plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually get 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, along with some technical instruction, each year. Technical direction consists of safety, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices likewise study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and companies. Most apprentices get in a program straight, however some start as assistants or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
