<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female believed the rate she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way might have conserved her a lot of money. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure.
