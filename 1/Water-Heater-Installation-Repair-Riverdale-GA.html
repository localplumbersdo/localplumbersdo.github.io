<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Riverdale GA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
