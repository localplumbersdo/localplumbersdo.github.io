There's constantly the possibility that your plumber's previous task will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to arrange your visit.</p>
