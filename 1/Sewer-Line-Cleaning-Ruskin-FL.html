<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate gradually, they slowly begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you discover it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, impacting your water quality.</p>
