<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water circulation. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to escape.

As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey.

While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
