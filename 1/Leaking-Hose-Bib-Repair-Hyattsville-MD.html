<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire security market, developing a redundancy designed to make sure that one check valve will continue to protect the city water system even if the other stops working. This assembly likewise enables the closure of one valve to reduce the pressure differential across the other, producing a more reliable seal and preventing even minor backflow leakage.

This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
