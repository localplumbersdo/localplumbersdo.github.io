<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Annapolis MD</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The total repair costs might remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater.

To see if your house has a water leak, you can also inspect your water meter before and after a two-hour period when you didn't use any household water.
