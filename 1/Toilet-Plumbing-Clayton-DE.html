<p>However, this cost can as much as double when streets, energies, driveways or pathways lie above the broken pipe. Displacing or bring back these ground-level components can run standard pipe repair costs as high as $25,000, if not more, for a single job.

<p>A brand-new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes.

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
