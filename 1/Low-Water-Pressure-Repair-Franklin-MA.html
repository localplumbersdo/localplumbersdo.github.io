<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested every year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require a yearly test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked yearly to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
