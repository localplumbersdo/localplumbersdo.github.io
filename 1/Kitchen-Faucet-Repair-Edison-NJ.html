<p>A few local authorities need that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high-end of the irrigated area. It might not be installed in any place where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some do not enable the use of a PVB at all, so contact your water service provider.
