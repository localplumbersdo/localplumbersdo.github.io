<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
