<p>Gas water heaters are simpler to repair than electric ones. A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal unit can grind soft, non-fibrous foods.

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated each year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated yearly to insure the security of the drinkable drinking water in your home.
