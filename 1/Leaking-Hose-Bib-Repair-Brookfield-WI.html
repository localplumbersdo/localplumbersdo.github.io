Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
