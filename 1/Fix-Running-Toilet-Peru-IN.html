<p>Unfortunately, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically ends up being destructive. Destructive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, especially in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More expensive gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are readily available. However they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
