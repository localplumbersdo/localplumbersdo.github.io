<p>You may be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, simply put, the very same thing, however without the zinc covering. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from wearing away from contact with moisture. While it does its task quite well, over time, it still does rust. We can help if you are currently experiencing clogged drains! When several of your drains are clogged, water will frequently begin to back up into your sink, which can lead to strange smells. A blocked drain can also trigger problems when flushing the toilet and result in other drain issues, like water leakages and bursting pipes.</p>

We have portable electric systems for inside your house or business and big gas and trailer systems for exterior problems.
