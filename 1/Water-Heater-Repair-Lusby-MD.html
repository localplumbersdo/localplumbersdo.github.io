<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to get away. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
