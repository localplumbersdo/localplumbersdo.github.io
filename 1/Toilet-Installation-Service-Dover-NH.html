The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>

If you're moving into a brand-new home, inspect the age of the existing hot water heater. You don't want to move into a brand-new home just to learn you're going to have to make a significant plumbing repair in just a year or more.</p>
