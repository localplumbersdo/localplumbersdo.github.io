<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to break and harden or merely be so squished that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We highly recommend likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
