<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Runnemede NJ</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
