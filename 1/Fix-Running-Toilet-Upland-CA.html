I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
