<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
