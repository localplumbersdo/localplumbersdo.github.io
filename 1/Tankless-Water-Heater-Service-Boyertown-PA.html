<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the start of our home enhancements. George and Anthony did a fantastic job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our house. I will always use them and request for George specifically for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and provided very good pricing for what we required done. I extremely advise this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
