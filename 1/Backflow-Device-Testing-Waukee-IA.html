Understanding if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be handy when working out the sale of a house. There are many kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's an excellent idea to get an entire house plumbing inspection in addition to a hot water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>To assist avoid clogs within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. Since the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
