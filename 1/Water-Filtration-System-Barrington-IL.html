<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>
