Noted listed below are examples of hazards and the minimum defense needed to be set up for each type of danger. The minimum approved backflow prevention assembly for unlisted threats will be identified on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>

Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly.
