Plumbing codes mandate that safe and clean water products be secured against backflow at all cross-connections. We provide the largest choice of backflow prevention solutions for any application.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
