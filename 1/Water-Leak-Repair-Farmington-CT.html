<p>Require backflow prevention assemblies and assemblies within a facility as laid out in the state required plumbing codes. The water suppliers generally do not have the ability to consistently check every consumer's premises for cross-connections and backflow defense. Typically, this would include the water service connection to each dedicated fire security system or watering piping system and the water service connection to each of the following types of properties: (1) properties with an auxiliary or reclaimed water supply; (2) industrial, medical, lab, other or marine facilities where objectionable substances are dealt with in a way that might trigger pollution or contamination of the general public water system; (3) facilities exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and premises where an internal backflow prevention assembly needed under the State Plumbing Code is not appropriately set up or preserved; (4) classified or limited facilities; and (5) high buildings.</p>

Some don't allow the usage of a PVB at all, so contact your water provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it ought to be installed in an area where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
