Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
