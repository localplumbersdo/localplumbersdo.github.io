<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a decrease in supplied pressure to the water flow. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes based on vehicle traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to get away. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
