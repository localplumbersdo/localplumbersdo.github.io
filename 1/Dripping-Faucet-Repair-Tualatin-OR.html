<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are plenty of quality kitchen sinks to pick from. For example, many consumers choose stainless-steel undermount sinks because they can take quite a bit of abuse for many years. Enameled cast iron sinks are likewise back in favor, and they are available in a large range of styles. You also need to choose about whether to have a single or multi-bowl  sink. The size of the bowl in addition to further options relating to the faucet are all elements of the procedure that we can help you with.</p>
