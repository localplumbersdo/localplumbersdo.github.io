<p>If you find a leak and select a patching job rather of a repiping job, simply remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same material and they may be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire house when you identify a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then begin at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
