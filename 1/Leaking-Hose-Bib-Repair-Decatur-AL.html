<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high risk" establishments.</p>
