Conventional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative result on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and use no waste water, no electricity and no salt or chemicals.
