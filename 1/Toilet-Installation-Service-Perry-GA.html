<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they typically happen in the lowest open drain. This type of problem is generally the result of an obstruction in the line. If you do not spot the smell coming from the sewer backup, you may determine this issue because a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for correct drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated problem with just that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
