<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
