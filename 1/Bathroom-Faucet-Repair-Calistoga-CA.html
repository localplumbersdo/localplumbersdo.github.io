<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman believed the rate she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently could have saved her a great deal of money. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
