<p>This is an entirely legitimate concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, of course, as important as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nevertheless, it includes a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly little cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any product particles by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
