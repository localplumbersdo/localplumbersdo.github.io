<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. occurs when there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on lorry traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
<p>A. We strongly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from back or unfavorable pressure in your watering system at shutdown from getting in back into your water source, thus minimizing the threat of contamination of your water source. Lots of towns require the use of an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may want to consult your local town prior to installing your watering system.</p>
