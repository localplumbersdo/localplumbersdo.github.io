<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished brine option after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose safely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes must have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air gap may be used to achieve this, and may be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>

It may not be set up in any place where it might ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not allow the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some do not permit the usage of a PVB at all, so check with your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer may spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it must be set up in a place where water spillage would not cause problems.</p>

<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the very first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks.

<p>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more suitable with soap and extends the lifetime of some appliances. Water softening is normally accomplished using ion-exchange resins.
