<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
