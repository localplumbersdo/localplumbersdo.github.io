<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
