And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust.

Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires complete water shut down while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little disturbance to your daily routine.

<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is merely capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
