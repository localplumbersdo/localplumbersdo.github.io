<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks beverages. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
