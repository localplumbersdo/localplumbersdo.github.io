<p>It's also a great concept to have your toilet examined if it was made before 1994, as older toilets are usually much less efficient than more recent designs. You might be losing hundreds of gallons of water and hundreds of dollars on an ineffective toilet. If you want to put brand-new pipes in your house or you're constructing a home, there are 3 kinds of brand-new plumbing pipe readily available that are building-code approved for houses-- copper, PEX, and CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride).

It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
