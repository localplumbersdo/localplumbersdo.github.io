<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Hampton VA</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it should be much less water.</p>

If you're moving into a new house, check the age of the existing hot water heater.
