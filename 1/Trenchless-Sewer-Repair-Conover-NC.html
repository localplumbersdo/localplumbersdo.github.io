<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of desired uses around your house.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly restored. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is heated up, hard water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to minimize these signs.</p>
