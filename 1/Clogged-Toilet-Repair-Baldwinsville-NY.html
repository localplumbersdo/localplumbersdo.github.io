<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called numerous of his member contractors to learn what a reasonable and reasonable  price would be for a waste disposal unit install. Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- typically sodium. The outcome is water that's been effectively softened by removing almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
