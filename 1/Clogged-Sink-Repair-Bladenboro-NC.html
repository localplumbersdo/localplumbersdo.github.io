<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Bladenboro NC</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
