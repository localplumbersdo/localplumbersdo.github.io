<p>Backflow prevention steps need to be kept on-site at all times during building and construction. Short-lived water will be allowed after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be connected to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker should be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser needs to be firmly attached to durable rebar or wood stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is substantially total is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is installed and immediately evaluated to ensure it is working.</p>
