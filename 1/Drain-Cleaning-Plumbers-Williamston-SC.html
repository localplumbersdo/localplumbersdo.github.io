<h3>Sewer Pipe Repair in Williamston South Carolina</h2>
<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your house.

Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
