<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains simultaneously in your home, then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in several locations and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.
