<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Bellevue NE</h3>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is provided for purposes of removing bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are definitely priorities for a municipality and its homeowners but tough water can negatively impact faucets and appliances in a home. With the high calcium material of local water, it can cause a dishwasher or water heater to malfunction. If the problem is recurring or the damage is comprehensive, you may be much better off repiping. For one-off problems and minor leaks, repairing the pipe is usually enough.</p>

Greater horse power: Horse power (HP) determines how powerful a waste disposal unit is. Garbage disposal HP ranges from 1/3 to 1, however for a lot of single-family houses a 1/2 or 3/4 HP unit will work just fine. You may consider a 1 HP garbage disposal if you have a large household or do a lot of cooking.</p>
