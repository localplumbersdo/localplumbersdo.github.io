<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that need to likewise be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl.

Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
