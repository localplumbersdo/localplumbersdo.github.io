<p>A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell. From brand-new bathroom components to custom-made countertops, we genuinely have everything. Our inventory makes us the best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
