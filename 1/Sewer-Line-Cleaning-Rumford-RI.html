<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
