Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and long lasting  option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures. The liner is left to harden in location for numerous hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. Once the procedure is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
