<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
