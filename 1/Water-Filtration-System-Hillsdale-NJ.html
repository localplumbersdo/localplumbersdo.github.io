<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>If you spot a leak and choose a patching task instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same material and they may be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
