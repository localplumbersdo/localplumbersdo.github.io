<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is specifically sensible to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when acquiring a new house. If Your Drains Are Slow, Call us For Professional Drain Cleaning. Plumbers are now able to use video technology to view inside sewer and water lines.
