<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
