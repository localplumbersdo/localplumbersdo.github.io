<p>If you home uses a septic system and drain field, you'll need an unique garbage disposal. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent blockages and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then shift to galvanized. I am unsure why that should be. It is also enabled to utilize black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized coating (which is generally a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>
<p>There are two popular mount systems utilized for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you've had a disposer set up for some time, it's probably installed by doing this) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the exact same job with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount mechanism is meant to be much easier to handle when setting up or repairing a system.</p>
