<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
