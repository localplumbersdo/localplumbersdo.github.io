When the tank leakages, your water heater is dead. The indication that your water heater requires changing is a slow drip below, normally showing up as a trail of rusty water. This indicates that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be repaired. Other symptoms, such as inadequate or no hot water, normally signal other hot water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>
