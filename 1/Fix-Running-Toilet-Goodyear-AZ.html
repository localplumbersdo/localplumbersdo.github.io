In a lot of states, other than Kansas, you are accountable for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or service.

<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Tough water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing totally. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the particles. Pictures 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one common type of valve. Even though other valves will look various, the clearing process is similar. However, you might need to eliminate a few screws on top of the fill valve to eliminate the cap.</p>
