The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement.

Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to leave.
