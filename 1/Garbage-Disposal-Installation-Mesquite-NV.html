<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
