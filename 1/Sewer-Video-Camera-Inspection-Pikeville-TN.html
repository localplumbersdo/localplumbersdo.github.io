<p>You can trust Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating with all sort of plumbing emergencies, including gas leakages. Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Generally, the cost savings have actually been based mainly on decreasing chemical and detergent costs. While those savings are still substantial, new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) also uses considerable water and salt cost savings.</p>

As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent to drain. This process continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about completely restored.</p>
