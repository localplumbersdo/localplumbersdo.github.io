<p>A couple of local authorities need that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any area where it may ever be immersed under water. Some municipalities do not permit the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't allow the use of a PVB at all, so talk to your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out of under the cap when backflow takes place, so it should be set up in an area where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
