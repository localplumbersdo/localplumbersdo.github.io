A little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the new line during installation.</p>
<p>You'll need an unique waste disposal unit if you home utilizes a septic system and drain field. The system needs to grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe comes up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but needs to then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that need to be. It is also allowed to utilize black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized finish (which is essentially an unique paint"). PG&E often does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
<p>Due to incorrect device installation or a gas line hookup that was not done correctly.
