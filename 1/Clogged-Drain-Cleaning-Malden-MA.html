There is no other way of knowing whether or not you have a tree root infestation without seeing it with a video camera inspection. You can roll the dice and wait for the very first rainstorm but I believe you 'd rather not.</p>

The system must grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields.
