There are a lot of types of piping systems and conditions, it's a good concept to get an entire home plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>To link a power cable to the new system, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you water with safe and clean water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are likewise required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
