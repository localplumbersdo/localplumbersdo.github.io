Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Garbage disposal baffles can be placed around the drain to help prevent items from being up to the system, such as utensils. They cost around $15.
