<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested each year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems need an each year test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested yearly to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has actually currently been fouled. Again, it is suggested to inspect the maker's directions for special preventative measures.</p>
<p>Because they can hinder the blades, cooking oil and other greases need to never ever be put down the garbage disposal. Finally, cold water ought to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to ensure that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from entering the waste disposal unit, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
