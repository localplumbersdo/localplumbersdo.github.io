We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the distinction between them? When it pertains to the concern of hard water, a standard water softener actually eliminates magnesium, calcium and silica ions, leaving it with small quantities of what is referred to as temporary solidity". The softener changes these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
