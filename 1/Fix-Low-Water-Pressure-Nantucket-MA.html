If health or ecological reasons require restricting sodium, substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride may be appropriate. In time, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has three cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regeneration procedure can be arranged immediately with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
