<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. When your existing set up instantaneous hot water system requires replacement, Bonney's knowledgeable plumbers can replace your immediate hot water dispenser or immediate warm water heater tank quickly and cost effectively. Garbage disposal units are set up under the kitchen sink. Installing one needs dealing with electrical and plumbing connections, so you need a licensed plumber to manage the task. Some garbage disposals have to connect with dishwashing machines as well. All of them should be connected to the p-trap.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
