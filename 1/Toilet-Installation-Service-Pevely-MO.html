<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job.

<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to develop your plumbing skills if you're relatively inexperienced. So save yourself some serious trouble by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is. Most backflow preventers are created to enable the components to be removed for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Getting rid of the backflow preventer to repair it is not necessary for the most part. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to assist in a repair. Knowing the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the problem if this is the case. You may have to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
