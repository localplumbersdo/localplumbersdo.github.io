<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
