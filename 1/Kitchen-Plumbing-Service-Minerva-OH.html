When the piping in your home starts to show any of these signs of corrosion, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the entire plumbing system. The reason a toilet will not flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause. Employing a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your primary step; a plumber can diagnose the problem and repair it.</p>

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
