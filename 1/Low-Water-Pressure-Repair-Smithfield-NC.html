<p>The next step for a hopeful plumbing contractor is to earn a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing company and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors typically consist of paying an application cost and passing a comprehensive business, law and building regulations test. Some community colleges and technical schools offer contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Additional requirements for potential plumbing entrepreneur might include evidence of monetary reliability, insurance and net worth.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a different style from the one we show, examine the instructions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are lots of quality kitchen sinks to choose from. For instance, numerous customers choose stainless steel undermount sinks because they can take quite a bit of abuse throughout the years. Enameled cast iron sinks are likewise back in favor, and they are available in a wide range of styles. You also need to decide about whether to have a single or multi-bowl  sink. The size of the bowl as well as additional options relating to the faucet are all elements of the procedure that we can assist you with.</p>
