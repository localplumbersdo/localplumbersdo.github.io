<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Dunn NC</h3>
<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a close-by warm water faucet up until you hear the gas burner in the water heater fire up. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Image 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Turn off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
