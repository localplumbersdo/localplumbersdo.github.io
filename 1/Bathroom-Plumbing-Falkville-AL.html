<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>And depending upon the setup of your house, the plumber might be able to access the large bulk of your system by doing this. For a 1,500 square-foot, two-bathroom home, you'll pay between $2,000 and $6,000 or more to replace just the exposed plumbing. Since you have to move rapidly in the face of a gas leak, having a plumbing company on hand that you can call is essential. Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating has service technicians extensively trained to find the location of the leak, and either repair or replace the pipe, depending on the seriousness of the leak.</p>
