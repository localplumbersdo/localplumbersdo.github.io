Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter have the ability to remotely line the section of the pipe that is split without needing to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned up and dried, the installers will use the lining to the issue area. The liner is cured in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the fractures inside the pipe.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger.
