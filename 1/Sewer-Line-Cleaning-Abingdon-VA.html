A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we reveal, examine the instructions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
