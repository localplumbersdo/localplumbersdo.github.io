<p>Cracked sewer pipes can be more than just an expensive repair-- they can lead to pricey and extensive home damage and lead to severe health dangers.

<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
