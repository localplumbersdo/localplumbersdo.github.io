<p>Run the hot water. Hot water is your good friend, particularly for your kitchen sink. Even if you are very cautious with what you put down your sinks, food remnants and cooking oils still get away down our drains - particularly the kitchen sink. Running the warm water after you've used your sink assists clear particles and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Funneling occurs when the incoming difficult water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.
