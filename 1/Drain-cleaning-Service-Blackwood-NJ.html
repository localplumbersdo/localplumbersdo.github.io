In older homes, aged gas lines can use and deteriorate out, allowing gas to seep through the pipes.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
