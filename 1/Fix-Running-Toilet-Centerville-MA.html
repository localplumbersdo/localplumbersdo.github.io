It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.
