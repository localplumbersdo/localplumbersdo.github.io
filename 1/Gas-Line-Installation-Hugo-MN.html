<p>To assist prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the approach laid out above. Because the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
