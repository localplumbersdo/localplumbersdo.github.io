If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you ought to take to safeguard yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
