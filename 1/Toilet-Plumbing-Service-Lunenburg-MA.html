<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is especially vulnerable to recurring pinhole leakages (corrosion that breaks through the surface area of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish rust on copper piping. Auto-reverse setting: Some waste disposal unit include this setting, which reverses the direction the blades spin to clear waste. This secures the blades so they do not break as fast. All leakages, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>

To prep your system for installation, you may need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
