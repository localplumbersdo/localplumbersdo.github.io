<p>Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise. A word to the wise: most house owner insurer will pay to repair a water leak and water damage to your house twice. But if it takes place a 3rd time, you run the risk of having your insurance provider drop you.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect in time, they slowly start to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to occur, so by the time you notice it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>
