<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
