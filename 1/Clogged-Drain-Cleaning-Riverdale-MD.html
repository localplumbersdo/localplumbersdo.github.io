<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
