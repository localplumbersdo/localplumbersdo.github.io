In some cases, a natural gas line may be covered if it is burst. This kind of circumstance might take place if a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line.

We advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to inform you of any prospective gas leakages if you haven't done so currently.</p>
