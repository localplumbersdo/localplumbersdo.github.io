<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Water softeners been available in all shapes and sizes and bigger certainly does not mean much better.

Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise protect the resin bed, so we do not need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regeneration to release firmness, dirt and sediment.</p>
<p>The term difficult water" may seem like an oxymoron, but it's simply household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium.
