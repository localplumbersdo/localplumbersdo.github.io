Double flush valves are ending up being increasingly more common, as both consumers and makers look for new methods to save water.

We've all heard the old adage, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, many people find that squicky - therefore the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just utilizing less water to do it.</p>
<p>Is your water heater making noises or leaking water? Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & A/c at (913) 432-3342 for skilled Merriam hot water heater services.
