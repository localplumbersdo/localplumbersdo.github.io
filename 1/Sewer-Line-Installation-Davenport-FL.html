<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are ending up being increasingly more common, as both consumers and makers look for new methods to save water. Dual flush toilets allow the user to select the level of water required to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or strong. We've all heard the old adage, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, many people find that squicky - therefore the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just utilizing less water to do it.</p>
<p>Is your water heater making noises or leaking water? Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & A/c at (913) 432-3342 for skilled Merriam hot water heater services. Installed under the sink, the waste disposal unit is implied for slicing up smidgens of waste food. When turned on the motor impellers and spins-- likewise called lugs-- throw little bits of food against a mill ring.
