<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring at the top counterclockwise until the system falls away. Eliminate the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

In many cases, a lack of hot water is brought on by a faulty breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank may be split. Scalding water is usually the outcome of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and should be right away dealt with by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
