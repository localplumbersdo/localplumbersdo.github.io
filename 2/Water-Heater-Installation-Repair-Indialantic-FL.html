<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
