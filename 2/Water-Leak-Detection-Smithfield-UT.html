<p>After getting rid of standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain prior to you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with warm water to clear the mixture. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water devices? This is a good indication that your pipes may be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be replaced. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water only comes with hot water, the cause might be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
