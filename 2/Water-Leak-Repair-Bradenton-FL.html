Numerous obstructions are brought on by putting too much bathroom tissue into the bowl. Know how much bathroom tissue your toilet can effectively rid the bowl of per flush.

<p>Standard water softeners found in home supply and hardware stores will remove nearly all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water during the softening procedure. Softeners likewise will eliminate approximately 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese.
