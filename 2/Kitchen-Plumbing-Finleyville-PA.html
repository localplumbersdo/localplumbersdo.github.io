<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water.

When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
