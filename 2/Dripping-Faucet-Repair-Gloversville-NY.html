<p>Leaks can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain fails. Since the tank or the entire toilet need to be raised off the floor for a correct repair, either of these leaks can be hard to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a much more expensive repair. Ryan's Plumbing has actually thoroughly trained workers who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating and cooling system, into the potable water system. This can happen through a procedure called backflow.</p>
