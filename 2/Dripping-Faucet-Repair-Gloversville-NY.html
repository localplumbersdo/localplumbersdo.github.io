<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to consumers. Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection.

This can happen through a procedure called backflow.</p>
