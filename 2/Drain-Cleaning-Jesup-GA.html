<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated, tough water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
