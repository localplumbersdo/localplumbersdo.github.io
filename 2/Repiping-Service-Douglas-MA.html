<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and prying off the maintaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<p>The garbage disposal is humming, but not turning. The waste disposal unit has actually ended up being jammed. IF IT IS JAMMED, NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL. Even if the unit is off, the blades are hazardous and sharp. Make certain the unit is off, you can even shut off the breaker to ensure it can't be turned on by mishap. Your garbage disposal comes with a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. If you can't locate this wrench, then try to place a broom plunger or handle into the sink drain opening and attempt to turn the jammed flywheel. If it seems to be moving freely turn the system back on (and do not forget to turn back on the breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
