<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect gradually, they slowly start to constrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure.

Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
