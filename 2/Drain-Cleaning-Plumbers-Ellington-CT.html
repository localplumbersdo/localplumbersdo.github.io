<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female believed the rate she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things in a different way might have conserved her a great deal of money. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

Salt is normally used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
