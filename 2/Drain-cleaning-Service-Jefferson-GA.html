<p>A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell. From new bathroom components to custom-made countertops, we really have everything. Our stock makes us the very best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
