If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you should take to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
