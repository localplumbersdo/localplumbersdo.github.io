<p>Lubrication might assist with the placement of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the technician put together the parts into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant must be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water supply is not polluted. In many cases the best lube is water. The usual use for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or wear out faster by bring in dirt and particles or restricting the motion of the element. The appropriate quantity of lubricant ought to make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never ever see pieces or globs of lubricant.</p>
