<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your safety, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. Your water is brown or red. Some kinds of pipes can rust over time. This rust will break off into your house's water supply and can turn your tap water a brown or reddish color.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>A freshly set up hot water heater must not produce weird noises, however it will start to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen drastically for homes with a high need for warm water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
