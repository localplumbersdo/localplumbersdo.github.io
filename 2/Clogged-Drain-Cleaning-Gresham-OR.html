<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Gresham OR</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

<p>Finding a plumbing contractor, either a company or individual, is a bit more difficult.
