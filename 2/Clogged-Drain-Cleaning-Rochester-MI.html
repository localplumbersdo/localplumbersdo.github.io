<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the potable water system and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An approved, correctly installed and maintained backflow assembly basically gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the distinction is inadequate to make any substantial modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4.
