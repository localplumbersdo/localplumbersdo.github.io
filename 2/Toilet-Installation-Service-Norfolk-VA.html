House owners are accountable for maintaining, repairing, and replacing natural gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the house's gas equipment. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a consumer's natural gas pipe or related connections, repair costs can be high.</p>

In addition, a Roto-Rooter van is displayed in the opening section of each episode. For some houses, water softening is just part of the solution. If you have iron, chlorine, or other impurity concerns that affect the security and quality of your drinking water, a water conditioner or neutralizer may be the service.</p>
