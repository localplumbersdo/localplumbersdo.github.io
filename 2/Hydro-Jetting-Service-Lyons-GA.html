<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).

This process continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
