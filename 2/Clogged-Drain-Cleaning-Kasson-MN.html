For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>This is among the very first and main concerns that you ought to ask yourself when it concerns repiping and replacing plumbing in your home. The age of your house is a vital element to understand whether you must repipe your home.
