<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the specialist assemble the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water supply is not infected. Oftentimes the best lube is water. The typical usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be lightly lubed to ensure they do not present of their retainer. Using too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or use out faster by bring in dirt and particles or restricting the movement of the component.

That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force.

That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>
