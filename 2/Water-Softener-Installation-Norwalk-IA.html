<p>A decrease in supply side pressure triggered by an occurrence such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire combating, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure once again surpasses the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>

At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.</p>
