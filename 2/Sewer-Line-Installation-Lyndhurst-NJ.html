<p>Those people in the market understand that cross-connection programs in lots of locations have greatly reduced the variety of reported incidents that take place within our water systems. This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever actually have been a problem in the very first place. This thinking can be both hazardous and counterproductive. Backflow incidents in water supply are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or nothing technique to backflow protection. We need to take a look at each installation for the risk it provides and then install the correct defense.</p>
