<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Tempe AZ</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines because pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>
