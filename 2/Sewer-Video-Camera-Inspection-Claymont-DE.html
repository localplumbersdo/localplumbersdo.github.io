<p>Replacing the ring that seals the connection in between the bowl and the sewer line means totally removing the whole toilet. So it's a. good time to consider getting a brand name brand-new toilet. A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working further into where the obstruction is happening.

We set up a short-term workaround at our guest bathroom sink, however after a day of this we understood that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.

If it blocks again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
