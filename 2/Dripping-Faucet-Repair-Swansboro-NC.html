<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Swansboro NC!</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>
