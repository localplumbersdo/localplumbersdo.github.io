<p>Leakages are sly. While the time needed will vary based on your house size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a really small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to arrange your appointment.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
