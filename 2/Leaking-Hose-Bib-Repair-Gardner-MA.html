<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
