<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
