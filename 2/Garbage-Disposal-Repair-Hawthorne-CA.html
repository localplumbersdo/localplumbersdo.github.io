Required to be outdoors, no limitation on elevation of sprinkler heads, and installed 18"- 60" above grade at the set up area.

<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Hawthorne CA</h3>
<p>Natural Gas and propane that comes out of the ground is completely odor-free. The egg odor related to gas is a chemical mixed into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security precautions you need to require to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
