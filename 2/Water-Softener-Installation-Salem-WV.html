<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
