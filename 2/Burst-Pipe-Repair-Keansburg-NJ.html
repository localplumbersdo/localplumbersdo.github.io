<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
