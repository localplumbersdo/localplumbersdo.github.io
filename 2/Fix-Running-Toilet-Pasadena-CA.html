<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily saved for later use when need rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
