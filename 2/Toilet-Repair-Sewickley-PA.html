<p>So, how does a softener know when to come down to service? The timing of regeneration depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water in fact needs it. Newer units use electronic sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based upon your water usage and for that reason just restore when needed. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
