In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and particular other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more suitable with soap and extends the life time of some devices. Water softening is usually achieved using ion-exchange resins.
