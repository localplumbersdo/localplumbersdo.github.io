<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the approach laid out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee. When the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially true. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
