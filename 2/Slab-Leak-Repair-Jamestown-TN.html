An authorized backflow prevention assembly has actually gone through an approval process at the Structure for Hydraulic Research and Cross-Connection Control at the University of Southern California. This is a two-step process of lab tests and a 12-month field test. Only assemblies effectively finishing the whole testing procedure are recognized by IRWD as authorized backflow prevention assemblies.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
