<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can occur when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines because pressure is lost throughout these events.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
