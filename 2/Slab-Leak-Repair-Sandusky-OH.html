<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in critical locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
