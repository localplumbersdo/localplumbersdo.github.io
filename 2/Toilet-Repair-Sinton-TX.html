<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to access to in-wall pipes, think about at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, changing exposed pipes in a utility, crawlspace, or basement room is relatively straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets need to definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
