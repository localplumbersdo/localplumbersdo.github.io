<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has taken place in systems which include gases and liquids.

Technical instruction consists of security, local plumbing codes and guidelines, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and companies. The majority of apprentices go into a program directly, but some start as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
