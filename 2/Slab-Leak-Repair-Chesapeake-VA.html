<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
