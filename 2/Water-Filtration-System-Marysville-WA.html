<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material coated with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Although water-producing companies do have the opportunity to produce softened water, they will not constantly do so. A water producing company just needs to include a water softener in its water purification system, to produce softened water inexpensively. Without a specialist having actually inspected your pipes, it can be challenging to know if repiping is the best response.

<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to business? The timing of regrowth depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water in fact needs it. Newer systems utilize computerized sensors that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other key metrics based upon your water usage and for that reason only regrow when needed. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
