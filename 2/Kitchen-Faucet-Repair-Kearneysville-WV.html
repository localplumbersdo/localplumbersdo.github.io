The riser must be securely connected to tough rebar or wooden stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is significantly total is prohibited unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and right away checked to ensure it is working.</p>
