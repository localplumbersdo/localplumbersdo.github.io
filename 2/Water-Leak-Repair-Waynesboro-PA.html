<p>Standpipe systems are used in many facilities, these systems are created to supply water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets strategically installed inside a structure. These systems generally are installed in big, open areas within structures, and in multistory structures for the purpose of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these buildings making it capable for a single person or firemen to provide a reliable and quick action to fire. There are two kinds of standpipe systems, the first type, are dry systems, which generally include no long-term water system and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire workers reacting to an event. A dry standpipe system requires no backflow prevention protection.

<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 telltale signs of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet.

Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>
