<p>In some cases called an auger, this useful tool can clear blockages that may be stuck even more down the system. You'll have to dismantle the drain and P-trap that runs below the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall. This is where you place the snake into the pipe up until you feel resistance to separate the clog. Remove scratchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener.

Temporary water will be permitted after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.
