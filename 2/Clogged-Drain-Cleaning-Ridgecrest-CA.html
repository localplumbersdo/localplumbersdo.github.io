<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water circulation, happens. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints.

The result is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape.
