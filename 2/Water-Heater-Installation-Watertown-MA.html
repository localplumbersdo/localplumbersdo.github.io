The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
