<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, consider at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a big job, changing exposed pipes in a basement, crawlspace, or energy  room is fairly straightforward, due to the fact that the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>

Compression: Common in older homes and utility sinks, these faucets have two handles for hot and cold water.
