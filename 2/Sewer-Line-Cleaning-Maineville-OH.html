<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
