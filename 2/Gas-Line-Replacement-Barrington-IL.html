<p>The cost of having your backflow preventer checked differs based upon your place and the companies you may choose from.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
