If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Examine the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
