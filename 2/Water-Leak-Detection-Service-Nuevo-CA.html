<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many home centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
