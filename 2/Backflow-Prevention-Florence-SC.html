Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and use no waste water, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance since the media can last up to 5 years without changing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a monthly basis.</p>
