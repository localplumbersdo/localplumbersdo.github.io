<p>Back-pressure is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system as the outcome of the downstream pressure being greater than the supply pressure. This reduction in supply pressure happens whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided (such as throughout water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water mains). Garbage disposal guarantees last approximately 5 years, but they can vary in between 2 and 10 years. Since the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to acquire an extended warranty. The majority of guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace regular wear and tear failures. To avoid additional breakdowns, house owners should stay up to date with routine maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>

Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would offer an estimate over the phone. All of them wished to take a look at the situation before committing to a rate, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
