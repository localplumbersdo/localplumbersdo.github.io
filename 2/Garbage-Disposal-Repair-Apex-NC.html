<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and split or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the area in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location.
