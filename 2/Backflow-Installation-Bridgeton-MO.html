Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no chance to supply one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

<p>There are 2 great reasons to insist on a sewer camera inspection of your hygienic and storm sewer before buying. If the house that you have your eye on is an older house in a fully grown neighborhood you probably have larger trees on or near the home.  Regrettably where there are trees there are typically tree roots and they like to find water inside of your sewer. There is no way of knowing whether you have a tree root problem without seeing it with a video camera inspection. You can roll the dice and wait on the first downpour but I believe you 'd rather not.</p>
