<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
