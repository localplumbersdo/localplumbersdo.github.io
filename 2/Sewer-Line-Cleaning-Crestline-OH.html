Some do not enable the use of a PVB at all, so talk to your water provider.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
