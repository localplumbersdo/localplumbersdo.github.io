<p>An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and below the very first check valve.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans.

For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>

We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to notify you of any prospective gas leaks if you have not done so already.</p>
