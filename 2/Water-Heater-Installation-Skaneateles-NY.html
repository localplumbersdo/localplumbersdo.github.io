<p>Take note of the area if you or anyone in the building starts to experience the above noted signs. Then it might be a gas leak, if symptoms affect people in a specific area.

Property owners can contact their local energy company, a licensed plumber, or the fire department if they feel security is compromised. Every toilet clogs once in awhile. How often a toilet blockages depends upon the strength of its flush, the cleanliness of its drain pipes, and what it's trying to flush.

Knowing the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
