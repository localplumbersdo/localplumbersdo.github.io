<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task.
