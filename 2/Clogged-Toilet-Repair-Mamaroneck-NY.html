<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific new sinks, however these will be identified to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, utilize a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
