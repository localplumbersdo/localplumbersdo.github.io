<p>When your water heater beings to weaken, you can see how it affects your day-to-day convenience. With a hot water heater replacement, you'll fix your repair concerns, and have improved water heater performance as well. The salt uptake through softened water depends upon the hardness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% salt uptake comes from drinking softened water. Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
