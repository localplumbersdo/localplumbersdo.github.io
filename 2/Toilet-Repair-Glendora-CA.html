Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines due to the fact that pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>
<p>For starters it will most likely have problem keeping up with the circulation of water and will begin to flood the area.

In cases where the clog can not be found instantly we'll utilize our inspection video cameras to inspect the storm drain system from the within with a real-time camera feed. We'll be able to identify the exact area of the clog and what's triggering it.</p>
