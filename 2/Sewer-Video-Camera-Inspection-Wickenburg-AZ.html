<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
