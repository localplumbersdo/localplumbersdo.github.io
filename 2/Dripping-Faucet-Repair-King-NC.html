Depending upon for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous desired usages around your home.</p>
