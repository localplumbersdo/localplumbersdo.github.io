<p>Consult your backflow prevention assembly manufacturer or the product spec sheets to verify that the assembly is USC-approved You should also verify the assembly is approved in the orientation for which it is being set up (horizontal, vertical, and so on).

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I enjoy to prepare, I produce a great deal of meals.

Fritz remained in and out of the home within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for 1 month. If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
