A garbage disposal solves all of those problems, including convenience. Just switch on water at the sink and the garbage disposal does the rest - and far more silently than you believe. By pulverizing food waste-- modern garbage disposals don't really use blades - it's processed by water treatment facilities where the small particulates are easily strained and turned into solid fertilizer, which, in turn, can be offered to decrease the general expenses of treatment.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you irrigate with potable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection.
