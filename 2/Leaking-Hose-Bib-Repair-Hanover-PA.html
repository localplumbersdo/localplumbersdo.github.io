<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Hanover PA</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many intended usages around your home.</p>
