<p>Salt-free systems will also lower scale buildup and provide brighter clothing and softer skin utilizing a much healthier technique. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to include salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance since the media can last up to 5 years without replacing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>
<p>A water firmness test would disappoint a decreased firmness. How do I know it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not take out the firmness to replace them with sodium.

You will no longer have the disadvantage to hard water, i.e., scaling, blocking and engraving of aerators while retaining the useful minerals. Also, because the minerals are not being pulled out of the water, you will not be reducing the pH, which can trigger water to become acidic helping it to remain alkaline which is very helpful for you and your house.</p>
