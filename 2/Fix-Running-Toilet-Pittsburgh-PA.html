<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the drinkable water system and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An approved, appropriately installed and preserved backflow assembly basically eliminates the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the distinction is insufficient to make any significant modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>A brand-new hot water heater will likely last longer, offer you fewer problems, and cost you less to operate gradually. Slow drains: If you observe that your drains are emptying slower, it might be a sign of the early stages of a clog. A well-trained plumber would not advise a replacement unless the original toilet was broken beyond repair, even if that holds true they may recommend moving toilets to various bathrooms to decrease any future blockages. Hot water heater need to be supplied by High 5 Plumbing.</p>
<p>Gas lines inevitably need repairs-- age and usage will eventually use them down.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.
