This is not just since your plumbing has aged with time, however also due to the fact that houses that were constructed prior to a certain period are more likely to contain galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is out-of-date in the world of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your house was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping.
