<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Do you see that you have flaky or dry skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg smell? It most likely goes without saying that leaking pipes must be changed right away. It may be regular to have condensation on hot water pipes, but it's certainly not regular for your pipes to spring a leak.

Toilets ought to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
