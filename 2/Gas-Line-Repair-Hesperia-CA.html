<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

An atmospheric vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not commonly specified by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.
