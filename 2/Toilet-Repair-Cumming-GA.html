<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Cumming GA</h3>
<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and switch on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a nearby hot water faucet until you hear the gas burner in the water heater fire up. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke doesn't draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Shut off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the problem.</p>
