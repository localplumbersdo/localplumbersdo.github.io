For double-bowl sinks, the best method to set about things is to utilize a constant waste disposer package consisting of a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
