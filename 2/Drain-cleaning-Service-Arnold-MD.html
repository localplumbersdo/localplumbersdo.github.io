<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being filled with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water triggers gray or white deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to lower these symptoms.</p>
