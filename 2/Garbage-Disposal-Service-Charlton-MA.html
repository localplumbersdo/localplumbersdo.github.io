<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
