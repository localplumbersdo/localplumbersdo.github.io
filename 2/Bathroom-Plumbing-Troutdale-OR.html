They are employed by building and construction companies, plumbing contractors and maintenance departments, or they may likewise be self-employed. Call Roto-Rooter today and inquire about our commercial waste disposal unit services or arrange a garbage disposal repair.</p>

Whether you've chosen to include a waste disposal unit to your kitchen for the very first time, have actually chosen that it is time to replace your current disposal, or think yours can be repaired, we are the group to call.

<p>Repairs are permanent and still extensive. Likewise, trenchless repairs can meet all industry standards. Sadly, the plumbing in older structures can fail. When the pipes start to corrode, it affects your water system. Contaminated water is a health hazard and must be dealt with quickly. Rust can also split, break, or burst pipes and destroy your floors or walls. We fix small leaks without repiping, but if you experience chronic leakage or a slab leak, it might be time for a total plumbing overhaul.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
