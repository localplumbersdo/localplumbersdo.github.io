When you buy a new disposal, the box will contain all the parts you need to install it. Before you delve into getting rid of the old unit, take a few moments to acquaint yourself with all these parts. Put them together in the appropriate order and check out the locking mechanism. Understanding how whatever fits together ahead of time will make the task a cinch.</p>

<p>If you find a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same product and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole home when you find a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
