Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water firmness can be gotten rid of fairly quickly by utilizing an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
