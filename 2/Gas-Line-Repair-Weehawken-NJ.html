<p>You'll need a special waste disposal unit if you home utilizes a septic tank and drain field. The unit must grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and permit the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields.

This is an excellent sign that your pipes may be rusting from the within and for that reason, need to be replaced. Remember that if the rust-colored water just comes with warm water, the cause might be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
