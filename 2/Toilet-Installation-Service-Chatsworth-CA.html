<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
