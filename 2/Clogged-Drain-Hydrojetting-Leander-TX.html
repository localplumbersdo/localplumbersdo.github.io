Every drain in your house is dependent upon the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated issue with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>

The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
