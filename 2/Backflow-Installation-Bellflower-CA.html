Greater horse power: Horse power (HP) measures how powerful a waste disposal unit is. Garbage disposal HP varies from 1/3 to 1, but for a lot of single-family homes a 1/2 or 3/4 HP system will work just fine. You might consider a 1 HP garbage disposal if you have a large household or do a lot of cooking.</p>
