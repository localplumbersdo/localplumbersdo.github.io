<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to work with a plumber for that burner set. The overall repair expense might be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.

Then there are the inconveniences of comparison shopping and the suspicion that the job might run into genuine cash. And lastly, failed disposers don't typically leak, a minimum of not in the beginning, so it's easy to put things off.</p>
