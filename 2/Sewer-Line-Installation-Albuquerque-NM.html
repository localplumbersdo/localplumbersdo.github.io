<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design).

This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
