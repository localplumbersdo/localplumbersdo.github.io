<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, check the directions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
