<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female believed the price she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently might have conserved her a lot of money. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
