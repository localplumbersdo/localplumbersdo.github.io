<p>Sediment Accumulation: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component.

To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>

When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a customer's natural gas pipe or associated connections, repair expenses can be high.</p>
