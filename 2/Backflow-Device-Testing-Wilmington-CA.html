It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
