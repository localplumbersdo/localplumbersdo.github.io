Electric hot water heater have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity.

<p>Note: Copper piping in the Florida area is specifically vulnerable to repeating pinhole leaks (deterioration that breaks through the surface area of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish deterioration on copper piping.

All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
