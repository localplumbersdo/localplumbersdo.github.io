The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when freshly regrowed. As difficult water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is warmed, difficult water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
