<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Rensselaer NY</h3>

<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in important locations where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
