It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure versus back pressure.

Using excessive lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or use out faster by bring in dirt and particles or limiting the motion of the component. The proper amount of lube need to make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You ought to never ever see pieces or globs of lube.</p>
