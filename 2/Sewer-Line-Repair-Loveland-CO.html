<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>As hard water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" sodium ions are released into the water. Softer clothing without tough minerals caught in the fabric. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the drab gray brought on by hard water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, fixing, changing and servicing our softener. Appreciate the time and service you send our method. The replacement tank has actually repaired the problem we were having.</p>
