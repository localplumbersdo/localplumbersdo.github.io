<p>Water heater repair can sometimes be cost-prohibitive. You'll spend for the essential repairs just to face another problem soon thereafter. Constantly continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has disappeared down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
