<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
