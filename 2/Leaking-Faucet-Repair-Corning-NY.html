<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.

<p>Sadly, when water is entirely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, especially in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. Many residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with special venting systems also are offered. But they're harder to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
