<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regenerated, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt.

The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. Hard water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
