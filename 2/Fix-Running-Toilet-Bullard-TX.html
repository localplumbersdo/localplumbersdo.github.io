A lot of toilet repairs in the Sugar Land, TX area include clogged drains, which happen when products get stuck in the pipes. In some cases, this involves bodily waste and can be cleared up with sensible usage of a plunger. When it doesn't, however, you need a qualified plumber to make it right.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.
