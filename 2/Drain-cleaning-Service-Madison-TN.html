<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
