<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Zionsville IN</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and gotten rid of. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any remaining pollutants.</p>
<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Basically, soft water conserves you cash.
