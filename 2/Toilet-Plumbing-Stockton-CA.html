Roots can become the smallest fracture or space in your house's drain pipe, where they flourish in the nutrient rich environment provided by the sewer. Flat roofs typically have drains spaced out around their boundary. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are usually connected to underground horizontal pipes connected to local storm sewage systems.
