<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
