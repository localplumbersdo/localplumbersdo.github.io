The pro will next check your hot water heater. With your hot water heater, he or she is looking at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless water heater ).

To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any accumulation.</p>
