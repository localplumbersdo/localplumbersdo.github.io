<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet in the Kitchen in Elkhart IN</h3>
<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This large amount of trash does not need to go in the trash bin if it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hampering water flow. By setting up a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
