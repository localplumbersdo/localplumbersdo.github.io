This device consists of no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.

This is a good sign that your pipes might be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be changed. Remember that if the rust-colored water only includes hot water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
