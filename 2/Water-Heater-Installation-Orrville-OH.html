Conventional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no drainage, no salt and no electricity or chemicals.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
