<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are some of the most crucial features of a business. Customers can leave your organisation with an unfavorable impression if toilets and urinals don't operate appropriately.

<p>Climatic vacuum breaker. Although you might have several atmospheric vacuum breakers on your system, the water will just stream through among them on its way to the emitters or sprinklers. For that reason, you only include the pressure loss for one vacuum breaker in your calculation. The majority of makers do not have pressure loss details for vacuum breakers, so assume a pressure loss of 2 PSI for a vacuum breaker if no manufacturer's literature is available.</p>
<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
