<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow, occurs. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to escape. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
