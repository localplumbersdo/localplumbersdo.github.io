<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in provided pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that enables water to escape. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
