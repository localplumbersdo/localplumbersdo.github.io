The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe what exactly was incorrect with the unit, how he fixed the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly recommend Hunter for any issues you may have.</p>

<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe in Livingston TN</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines since pressure is lost throughout these occasions.</p>
