Bell Cow can use replacement options and installation services for a variety of bathroom components if the problem is related to the appearance of a cracked or damaged vanity.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most typical. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the large, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<p>Search for a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.)
