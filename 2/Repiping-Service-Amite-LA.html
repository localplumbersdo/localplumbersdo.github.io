<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be performed through the taps. This will trigger your water to look rusty or brown, and the water might have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your house begins to reveal any of these indications of rust, you will undoubtedly need to repipe the entire plumbing system.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
