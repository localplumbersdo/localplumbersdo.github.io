Running the hot water after you have actually utilized your sink assists clear particles and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Transporting occurs when the incoming hard water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected.
