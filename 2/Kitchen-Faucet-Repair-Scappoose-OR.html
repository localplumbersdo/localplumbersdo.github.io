<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be).
