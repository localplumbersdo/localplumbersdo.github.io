<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls under this brief area of pipe before it can reach the water heater's control valve. The required length of the drip leg varies. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need less repairs in time. If you see your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are running out of hot water extremely quickly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a hot water heater inspection.

Most backflow preventers are designed to allow the parts to be removed for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Removing the backflow preventer to repair it is not required in many cases. Some parts such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to help with a repair. Understanding the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
