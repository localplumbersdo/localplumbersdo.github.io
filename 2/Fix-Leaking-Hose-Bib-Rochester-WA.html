<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Rochester WA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continuously kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
