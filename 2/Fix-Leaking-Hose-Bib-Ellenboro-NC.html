Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the baking soda and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will also keep pipes running smoothly.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
