<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.
