<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to get away. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
