<p>With over 45 years of experience to our name, Costs Frusco Plumbing and Heating is your number one choice for plumbing and HEATING AND COOLING services. Contact us today or send us an e-mail for your drain cleaning services needs. Remember that most of plumbing problems are simple for a professional to fix when they are caught in a prompt fashion. If you are experiencing any of the above signs in your household, make a consultation to have a plumber detect the concern. The faster you fix plumbing problems, the less expensive the repairs.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). Inspect the instructions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
<p>If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we recommend changing your system if it is over 10 years old. Under no circumstances must you ever try to fix gas leakages yourself. Contact a membe rof our gas pipe installer team to receive assistance with a gas line replacement, installation, or repair job in the Chicago residential areas. We provide gas line replacement alternatives in locations such as Clarendon Hills, Darien, Lisle, Plainfield, Wheaton, Westmont, and Naperville, Illinois.</p>
