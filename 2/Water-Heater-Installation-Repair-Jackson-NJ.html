A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800).

<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Jackson NJ</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
