Since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
