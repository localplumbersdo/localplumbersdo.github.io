<p>Your sewer line problem can lead to sewer backups, and they usually occur in the most affordable open drain. This type of problem is typically the outcome of a blockage in the line. If you do not find the smell originating from the sewer backup, you might determine this issue due to the fact that a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your house depends on the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated problem with only that drain, which is not most likely to be a sewage issue.</p>
