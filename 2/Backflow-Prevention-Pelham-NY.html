Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
