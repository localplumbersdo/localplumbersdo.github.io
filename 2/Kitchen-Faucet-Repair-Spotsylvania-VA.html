<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Spotsylvania VA</h3>

<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly restored. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these symptoms.</p>
