<p>Your first step is to shut down the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
<p>Small Leaks - A leak doesn't constantly imply that your water heater's going, it might simply be condensation. However it likewise could mean that your tank welds or pipe fittings are worn. A plumber is needed if this is the case. When most people think of plumbers, they typically call them for pipes concerns.

House owners ought to think about whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which signifies a high degree of experience, certifications and knowledge.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
