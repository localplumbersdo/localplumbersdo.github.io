<p>After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water coming from your water devices? This is a great indication that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be replaced. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water just features warm water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
