<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Naugatuck CT!</h3>
<p>Drip Leg - Any dust or grit in the gas line falls into this short area of pipe prior to it can reach the hot water heater's control valve. The needed length of the drip leg varies. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require less repairs over time. If you discover your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are running out of hot water extremely quickly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a hot water heater inspection. The California Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) needs licensed plumbers to restore their license every 2 years.</p>
<p>We offer fast, same day service and will send an experienced professional to your house or business and do our best to ensure that you have hot water again as rapidly as possible. Whether our Charleston repiping experts find a small amount of bad piping or we discover problems with your whole system, the team at McAtee Plumbing Heating & Cooling will prioritize your security and budget plan in any job we handle. After all, you called us to fix your piping problems, not your pocketbook.</p>
<p>Commercial - Lower mineral scale, soap usage, and energy intake in your plumbing and other devices. Job well done: You do not wish to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the task to a qualified plumber ensures a smooth installation process. If there is a leak, we will locate the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has actually not currently been finished. Then, our service technician will dig to find the gas line and leak. The gas line will be replaced and pressure tested to guarantee there are no leakages. The website will be tidied up and brought back to its previous splendor if the leak is sufficiently fixed.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the concern if this is the case. You might need to check out using a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
