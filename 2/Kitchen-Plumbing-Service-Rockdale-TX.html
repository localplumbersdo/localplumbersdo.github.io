<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane.

Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>
