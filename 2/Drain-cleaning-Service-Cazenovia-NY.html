Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need fewer repairs in time. If you observe your water is taking too long to get hot, or you are lacking hot water really quickly, it is time to call a professional plumber for a water heater inspection. The California Contractors State Licensing Board (CSLB) needs licensed plumbers to restore their license every two years.</p>

From water heater repairs to routine maintenance to complete replacement, our plumbing experts have you covered.</p>
