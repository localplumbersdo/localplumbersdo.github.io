The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that permits water to leave. Often no apparent physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
