<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach set out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
