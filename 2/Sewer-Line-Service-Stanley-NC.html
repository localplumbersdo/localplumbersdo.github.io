<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force.

That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
