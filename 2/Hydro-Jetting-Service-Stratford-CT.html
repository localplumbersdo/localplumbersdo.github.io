Throughout sewer camera inspection, our technician will find a gain access to indicate your sewer line and after that insert a high-definition camera that provides a feedback to the service technician as it travels through the pipeline. Aging: If your hot water heater isn't working like it used to and it is at or above 10-15 years of age, it might be time to replace your system.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
