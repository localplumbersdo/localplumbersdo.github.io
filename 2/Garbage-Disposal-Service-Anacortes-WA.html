When the pressure drops for some reason such as might happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario takes place, polluted water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention approach used.

The correct backflow prevention device is needed if an air space is not possible.
