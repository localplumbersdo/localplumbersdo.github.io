Huge Blue Plumbing can purchase and manage the permit process. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers need to be evaluated regularly to guarantee they are operating correctly.
