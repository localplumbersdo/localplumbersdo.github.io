<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
