Homeowners are accountable for keeping, fixing, and changing natural gas pipes that range from the utility's gas meter to the home's gas equipment. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a customer's natural gas pipe or associated connections, repair costs can be high.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly restored.

The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated up, tough water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
