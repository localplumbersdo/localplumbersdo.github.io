<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Shrewsbury MA? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Because pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>

Excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
