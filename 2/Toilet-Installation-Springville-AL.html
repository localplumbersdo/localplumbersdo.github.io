Backflow is a problem due to the fact that it can cause wastewater to recede into a house, polluting the drinking water. Cover the flapper valve with your hand.

<p>The term hard water" might seem like an oxymoron, however it's simply household water which contains high concentrations of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium.

Just like our trenchless services, we will initially perform pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
