<p>Leakages are sly. While the time needed will vary based upon your home size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to reserve as much as 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the job (unless you have an extremely little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to arrange your consultation.</p>
