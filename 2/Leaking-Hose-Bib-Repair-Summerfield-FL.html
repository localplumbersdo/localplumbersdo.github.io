When it concerns the concern of tough water, a traditional water softener actually removes magnesium, calcium and silica ions, leaving it with little amounts of what is called short-lived solidity". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
