<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another common issue homeowners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This concern is frequently triggered by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as basic as a worn flapper valve. A drip pan is affordable and effective. The drip pan is set up under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an ideal drain. When the water heater is being replaced, a perfect time to install a drip or replace pan is.</p>
