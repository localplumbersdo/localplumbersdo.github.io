<p>This ion exchange process is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can deal with sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this procedure if it doesn't work the first time.

Basements and energy spaces include a few of a home's most important and often used residential plumbing fixtures. Roto-Rooter's professional plumbers provide a full variety of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning services, but basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most typical. To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>

Other good alternatives are overload defense, which switches off the motor if it starts to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the filthy dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal specifically created to be used with a septic tank. gives a summary 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
