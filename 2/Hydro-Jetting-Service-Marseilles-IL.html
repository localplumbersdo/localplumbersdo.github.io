Backsiphonage is backflow brought on by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water system or customer's potable water system.

<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for many years to come. Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water features need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows take place from them, these water functions are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place need to be shown on building plans.
