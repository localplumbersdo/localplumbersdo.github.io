Electric hot water heater have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the difference is not enough to make any considerable modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring.

<p>A new water heater will likely last longer, offer you fewer problems, and cost you less to operate in time. Slow drains: If you see that your drains are clearing slower, it might be a sign of the early phases of a clog.

Water heater should be offered by High 5 Plumbing.</p>
