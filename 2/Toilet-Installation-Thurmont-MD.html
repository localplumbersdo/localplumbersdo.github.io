<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals can weigh 15 lbs. or more. That's a great deal of weight to suddenly capture with one hand while you're turning the lower mounting bracket with the other hand.
