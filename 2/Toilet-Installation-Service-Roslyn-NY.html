<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing company. A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Clogged drains are an annoyance. Whether it's a clogged toilet or water that isn't draining pipes correctly in a sink or tub, it can lead to unsightly and destructive plumbing repair issues.

We utilize Type L" copper, which is the leading grade of copper. We believe that if you are going to buy copper piping, do it as soon as, do it right.</p>
