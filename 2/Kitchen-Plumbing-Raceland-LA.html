If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you must require to secure yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
